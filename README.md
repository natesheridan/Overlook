## Abstract  
Overlook is a web application put together at the end of module 2 at Turing. This application features a landing page where a "customer" from a "hotel" can login with their given username and password ('customer<cusnum>':'overlook2021). After logging in the user is presented with a home page where they can see their bookings and the total amount of money spent on all the rooms combined. They also have the option to make a new booking on a seperate page. All of which is tied together with a backend API that is hosted on Heroku.
## Technologies  
 - HTML
 - CSS
 - Javascript
 - WebPack
 - SASS for styling
 - Heroku for backend data
 - Mocha and Chai for testing
